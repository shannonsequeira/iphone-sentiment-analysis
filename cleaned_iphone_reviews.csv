Jnan Shetty,5.0 out of 5 stars,30-Dec-23,Apple iPhone 13,Colour: BlueSize: 128 GB,Using after 3 months honest review,"This is my first iPhone and it always feels good to hold this masterpiece. This looks premium not just because of its branding, it has everything which makes it feel premium. However, despite all the looks and finish, the transition from Android to Apple is not very smooth and you may constantly lack certain features that can make life easy. I was using vivo y19 Lite before this and still have that phone with me. Putting out the feature that is being missed by me-1. Forwarding Anything in Whatsapp: Forwarding anything in Whatsapp from IPhone takes bit more step as compared to what is being offered in Android. This makes the entire process slow for an Android User2. App Switcher: Apple could have easily made App Switcher easy with just light Swipe up, instead they made it with long pressed Swipe up. Why man, why.. You don't have any features for Swipe up, just make it easy to launch.3. Andorid Dialer is Always Missed: Every android has a basic feature, where you can search the contact directly from Phone Dialer, here Dialer is used for Dialing Number only and it will not suggest you similar contact from contacts or last Dial. This is really bad.. If you have to Dial a number directly, use Dialer.. If you have to dial someone from Recent Call log, shift to that and if you to dial someone from contact, shift to that. Man, all this can be done under one button, under dialer. Android user will miss this very badly.4. Sending Multiple Files in Whatsapp: If you wants to add more than 1 file directly from whatsapp, you have to do it twice. In Android, one can simple start selecting from whatspp itself and can select as many files as they wants and can send in a single click. Here for sending multiple files, you have to go to gallery or folder and select all files first and share it through whatsapp.5. No Swipe based shifting from Chats to Status and to calls: In Android Whatsapp, you can switch between Calls, Chats and Status by just swiping, here you have to press button of each.6. Contact Viewing: Contact list sorting method is still out of my mind. Man, make it easy. For example, if one of your contacts First Name or Middle Name or Last Name, any one of thing start with Alphabet ""A"", than it will be shown on top of the list. Apple, pls adopt any one method or at least allow us to customise it.7. Many Apps in Android are much more refined than its version on Apple.8. This is for those who had use Samsung Pay: Samsung Pay was one of the best app for making UPI or Card Payment, just swipe up from home screen of Samsung Phones (Only S Series) and the app is open for payment, I miss that here very badly.9. Lack of Dual Messenger Facility: You can't use two different WhatsApp numbers here in the same phone, as supported in all android right now.These are the issues that I face right now. Apart from this, the phone is good, the sound is loud and clear, it Feels Premium in Hand, the Touch is very good and Face ID works like a charm. Gesture control customisation is really good and you can customise a lot of things.",3057

Adeeb,4.0 out of 5 stars,19-Aug-24,Apple iPhone 13,Colour: PinkSize: 128 GB,Stunning Design and a Beautiful Pink!,"I finally upgraded from my trusty iPhone 5s to the iPhone 13, and let me tell you, it feels like I’ve time-traveled from the past to the future! The pink color is absolutely gorgeous—it's the perfect blend of subtle and stylish, making the phone look sleek and modern. I’ve received so many compliments on it already.The design is everything you’d expect from Apple: premium, well-crafted, and just a pleasure to hold. Coming from a 5s, it’s almost like I was using a rotary phone before this. I half-expected Siri to say, “Welcome to the 21st century!”The display is bright and vibrant, the camera is a huge leap forward, and the overall performance is incredibly smooth. It’s crazy how much has changed—face ID feels like magic, and the battery life is a dream compared to my old 5s, which needed a charger practically glued to it.If you’re thinking about upgrading, especially if you’re coming from a much older model like I was, don’t hesitate. This iPhone 13 in pink is a stunner and well worth the leap!",1009

loading,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Jun-24,Apple iPhone 13,Colour: PinkSize: 128 GB,Still one of best base flagships out there in 2024,"Things I liked:1. Solid Build Quality and very polished software (compared to Samsung's One UI)2. Camera:-Rear: Rear camera is pretty decent with good color accuracy in all lighting conditions. Videos are steady and smooth.3. Mic / Speakers: Mic is exceptionally well, isolates all background sounds in noisy situations. Speakers are crisp with good bass.4. Performance: This is where the phone shines, you can throw any app available on the App store and it will run it without breaking a sweat.5. Face Id works like charm, it's the best biometric phone lock out there undoubtedly.Things I wish were better:1. Battery life would have been better, I get up to 4.30 - 5 Hours SOT with mixed usage (high brightness, 1 hour calls, 2-3 hour social media, and 2 hour media playback/music)2. Charges Slow compared to my earlier Samsung. Takes almost 1.2 Hours from 20% to 80%3. Front camera is average, it fails to get correct skin tones and lighting. I keep it on default and still it produces over saturated photos.4. Dialer / phone app sucks. I am someone who makes up to 200 calls a day due to nature of my SCM work. Dialer on Samsung is far better. For unknown call you can add a note to the number in Samsung and it reflect when the person call you again, without having to save unnecessary contacts. Number pad does not detect contact unless complete number is typed.",1368

Cost is wall for me. - The photos are nice and feature like exposure adjust and filter was good and quality photos . And the 5x zoomed photos is not good for me.it reduced the pixel quality .- The video and optical image stabilisation was mind blowing . i mostly explore on videos . it was soo good , no words other than that.AND THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR ME NOW IS IOS UPDATEi turned off the auto update at first place .i heared about DISPLAY ISSUES,HEATING ISSUES and BUGS in the ios updates for 13 and 14 series.So for expencive and established brand like apple does not fair . This is the only -ve i have to say as a reminder .Also i heared without ios update display issues are happened . Buy the way it is a hardware issue one of the display provider company's batch may show the issues . but we customers cannot identify which company provides the hardaware.I will attach my battery analytics data screnshot photo here so you can better understand how the battery is good The ordering experience in the greate indian sale was worst . I planned to buy this for 45999/- in oct7 greate indian sale offer but i got canceled then i bought for 48999 that was disppointed .As a whole i didn't recommend base models ,i felt i must have buy pro variant but for person who need ios in affordable price i recommend 13 is better than 14",2924
debarghyo chaudhuri,4.0 out of 5 stars,30-Jul-22,Apple iPhone 13,No Details,Review after 1 week of usage,"Got it for 65K on Amazon prime day. So as a lifelong android user I have switched to IOS. So will be dividing this into the pros and negs:Product red 128GBPros:1) Received genuine product from Amazon( was quite sceptic about it though)2) Built quality excellent3) Camera quality excellent. True to life color reproduction, Indoor conditions amazing, night photos are good, facial tones are very good, day clicks are amazing. In short it's an amazing exp. Selfie cam also produces very good quality images. And also no shift in dynamic range while shifting B/W wide and ultra wide cams.4) Display:- Its a really great display, not 120 hz, but the experience is no less than a 120 hz, coz of apple's great software optimization, buttery smooth, no jitters on the screen, won't feel like a 60 hz panel. Now the notch, yes it will be bothering a little bit but its got its own functions, face unlock and stuff (works great in all environmental conditions)after a little while you get adjusted and it got its own magic functions like when when the phone rings and you go close to it, it detects your presence and lowers the vol level.5) Performance: Most powerful processor in the world.6) Battery:- With light usage will easily go for 2 days and with heavy 1 day. Remember to follow a charging pattern and it will give a solid battery exp.7) Speakers: Very loud with a small thumpCons:1) To keep photos and stuff you need to buy storage. 5 GB by default but that's nothing. Download google photos as an alternate sol. if you don't wanna buy storage.2) File management system sucks, android is much better.3) It has dolby atmos but for that you need a subscription to Apple music.4) Does not have a telephoto cam, which I think is a must at this price point.5) Somehow I am not getting 4g+ on my airtel, don't know why but in my android phone always used to get that.6) No USB C7) Siri is dumb AF8) Apple maps are not good, so download Google maps.9) Google keypad is much better than apple's.10) Notification panel and those small things like typing in the notification panel and other things that you can do in android is much much better than apple.11) As of now no haptic feedback while typing maybe coming on IOS 16Note:- Apple ecosystem still exploring that part but whenever you click any pic it automatically gets updated and I can see it in my Macbook also.Overall I would say if you are planning to buy a phone for responsiveness and does the everyday stuff without any hanging problems and stuff then buy it, and also if you are planning to keep it for a long time, then I think its a good investment for the future. Its got Great resale value.Hope this helps in making your decision easier.Update after 2 weeks of usage:All the above points remains the same, but I did check out the ecosystem and the experience has been amazing.1) I can receive and make phone calls (cellular calls) from my macbook, and the call quality is also good.So basically you can keep your phone in some other section of the house and you are working with your macbook somewhere else and if some call comes you can receive that on your macbook. PS:- your phone and macbook should be connected to a similar network, i.e wi-fi.2) Airplay- Just from the lock screen itself i can play any video and also listen to music from my phone. So basically you can watch youtube amazon prime videos(app not in the macbook but present on phone) and other stuff and also listen to music, and the switch of devices is also seamless. So someone in my house can use my macbook to watch movies on amazon prime(playing from my phone) and I can browse linkedin or FB from my iphone.",3644

Stable videos with no shaking- battery life is good. Lasts an entire day with medium use. I don't game on the phone. Charging is as quick as it is with phones that use USB C.- display is soo good. So bright- built is solid, dropped phone a couple of times once with the cover and once without and not even a scratch.- listening to music and watching videos is a hot cos of how good the speakers r. Crystal clear with the right amount of bass and treble.Cons- phone is a tad heavy and using it for hrs on a stretch can result in pain in the wrist or fingersGot the phone in Diwali sale on discount so bang for buck if u ask me",806

ApTreX,5.0 out of 5 stars,06-Feb-22,Apple iPhone 13,Colour: PinkSize: 256 GB,Truly worth the money spent! Even if you go broke!,"My honest review after going broke buying this depreciating object.I have been using android phones since the last 10 years and finally decided to switch to iPhone! I used to roast iPhone for its prices, lack of features and also things like power adapter not given in box etc, but my last android phone (iqoo 7 legend) had lot of software related issues and battery issues after updating it to android 12, tired of bugs and software glitches in android, I finally decided to buy a iPhone and switch from android to iOS And Boy Was I right!I never even held an iPhone In my life before because of its price, but now I made a great choice even if I had to spend all my savings on it.iPhone 13 is so smooth that even my IQOO 7 Legend with 120hz feels slower than it even if iPhone has only 60hz. And I can’t believe what I’m seeing, all the games/apps are so much smoother and optimised than on android.I was very sceptical about the charging speed of an iPhone Because in Iqoo I had 66w fast charger where as for iPhone I had to buy 20w separate fast charger for 1800rs, but charging speed isn’t disappointing.Display quality is truly flagship level and I’m quite a fan of the small 6.1 display believe it or not, being able to reach the top of display with just one hand is very helpful, Build quality is great.I would recommend NOT to waste extra 40k for buying 13 pro. Because I don’t think having a extra camera telephoto lens is worth spending 40k.You can see in the 3rd image attached the quality of wide angle camera pic shot on my iPhone 13, wide angle camera struggles in low light, but main camera is really good, captures true colours. Front camera is really good too, truly flagship.Speakers are Great.Battery life is better than my previous devices,iOS is very optimised in terms of battery life, easy 8hrs sot on normal usage.NOTE : While playing BGMI you loose around 2% battery every 6minutes at HD + Extreme Graphics. Which is also good. Pro Max Would Be far better in terms of battery.For the software? Yes I feel like there are few downsides, even if the software is very smooth and has very less bugs, it has two annoying things : any game gets paused when you open control centre just to check the battery etc, Lock Screen is annoying and also having to reach the top left corner just to see notifications is also annoying, clearing all notifications is also very annoying.But other than that a perfect 10/10 purchase. I was very disappointed at myself when I paid for the iPhone but when I received it I was truly happy that I bought it.Truly worth it.",2573

Prasanna,5.0 out of 5 stars,22-Sep-22,Apple iPhone 14,Colour: RedSize: 128 GB,Exceeding my expectation. Go for it.,"About the phoneApple phone without a second delay, I would say it is better than all android phones I have used. The phone is like water, it flows in a way you want and shaping in your way. In a best way possible, the phone is designed to only show what the user wants and eliminating unnecessary ads, features that I have seen in android.Why it is better than Android?You pay too much money for Apple products, obviously you experience the features, physical components , camera lens etc. Apart from basic things, you can also enjoy the best applications available in app store. If you are a developer you might know the app store policy for application publish and their security posture towards handling payment apps etc. They publish best application and the way the apps, its modules switches is just flawless. Due to the so called strict policy of privacy program with Apple products, iPhone can pop up a box in your screen if any apps wants to track your activity with other applications. +1 respect for apple to show such concern with user.Apple phones are same ? like 13 vs 14The reason 14 is same as 13 may be business practice followed from 11th edition. But please note that iPhone making changes internally like physical components (small change in battery performance, lens in 14 edition), additional features but that may not satisfy you to buy 14 edition. If you do not find ""the very few changes"" interesting in 14,  go for 13. Because physical and even cameras are not visually very much different in 13 vs 14 comparison. Also you get 13 for cheap :)14 is just added features but that is not for daily use, the features real time use is rare case. But the best part is there is no extra cost between 13 vs 14 prices (except extra 10k slash)Concern you must have.Apple is not giving chargers and their silicon cases are very expensive (but very good in touch and scratch friendly in back due to silk layer). This is an issue for sure. You have to buy charger not coming with USB C and claiming that you help carbon footprint, understandable but not customer friendly business model. Even after the purchase I had to spend at least 7k for charger and case.Apple care.I am not buying it, I pay for phone which is already expensive for this premium and apple care does have strict policy that if you understand that is waste. Instead I find a private insurance to make things better.",2397
sravani gupta,5.0 out of 5 stars,26-Jul-23,Apple iPhone 14,Colour: MidnightSize: 128 GB,Amazing Product,"The Apple iPhone 14 is overall a great phone for anyone who is looking for high speed, excellent camera quality, and a day-long of battery life. The squared-off sides are more comfortable to hold in your hand in my opinion. I purchased this one and so far my experience has been wonderful. Something I like about this phone is its fast speed along with the different options the camera gives you. I wouldn't say the iPhone 14 has a better camera than the 13, rather I think they are more similar and there wasn't a dramatic improvement. The battery life is something that I wish was a little longer. It last about an hour or two more than the average iPhone 13, but does charge faster. I have been able to receive about a 50% charge in 30 minutes. Another great feature of this phone is the painless eSIM setup. Being able to set up the SIM card virtually and not a physical transfer on your phone makes carrying over carriers from phone to phone much easier. battery lasts as long as the iPhone 13. As you may remember, it was much better than the iPhone 12. The iPhone 14 is a smooth, responsive phone and great for high-quality gaming or photo and video editing. Overall I think this is a great phone to purchase if you are looking for a durable and sustainable upgrade and I do think it is worth the extra hundred dollars from the 13.",1338

It respects user privacy if you are not using third party apps. My options were stock android without google (something like lineageOS) or iPhone. I tried lineageOS but there was always something breaking in my phone. It couldn't become my daily driver; I wish most of the things in android were open source like maps and some other proprietary google apps. In the current state, I was left with choosing iPhone. For long, I had debated with myself about buying iPhone or not, I was using OnePlus 7T for last 3.5 years. The phone stopped getting updates and had many bugs. The software changed a lot, I hated it. All these OEM betraying consumers made me switch to iPhone in the end. I can't trust any other brand to have the consistency like apple has. That's my take in the phone market. I wish there was a consistent bloat free android brand with a great camera.",957

And the audio jack..(as i am not airpods friendly person). Silent slider is super!! E-sim is not new but still creative. I liked it.Coming to accessibility, for first few days or a couple of week, you will feel uncomfortable and inconvenience while finding few settings and applications as you are addicted to Android. Don't panic, be calm and use 'google' baba or youtube 'didi' to find ways to get particular settings yoh are searching for in iphone. There are ton's of video's on it.

If it was going to take time that could be mentioned and particular slot of 3-4 hours could be given instead of wasting 2 full days of my time.

It's working perfectly. Also, i would like to add, the packing of such an expensive device was not up to the mark. I have seen how well Apple packs the box and ships to its customers in videos of people from other countries. The Amazon seller just put it in a large plastic bag. Though the box was unharmed when it reached me, I could still notice a little dented corners on the box, which could have been avoided if they had packed the box in a bigger carton with foams.",755

Peeyoosh Kumar,5.0 out of 5 stars,28-Jul-23,Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max,No Details,The iPhone 14 Pro Max: An Epitome of Excellence,"Here is my review of the iPhone 14 Pro Max after using it for a couple of weeks:The iPhone 14 Pro Max is the most advanced and powerful smartphone that Apple has made. It offers a stunning design, a superb display, a pro-level camera system, and a blazing-fast performance. It is not a cheap device, but it is worth every penny if you are looking for the best of the best.Design: The iPhone 14 Pro Max has a sleek and elegant design that feels premium in the hand. It has a flat 6.7-inch OLED display that covers almost the entire front of the device, with a pill-shaped notch at the top that houses the Face ID sensors and the selfie camera. The back of the device is made of textured matt glass that resists fingerprints and scratches, and the frame is made of stainless steel that adds durability and shine. The device comes in four beautiful colors: Space Black, Silver, Gold, and Deep Purple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max also has an IP68 rating, which means it can withstand water up to 6 meters deep for up to 30 minutes.Display: The display of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of its main highlights. It features a Super Retina XDR OLED display with a resolution of 2796x1290 pixels and a pixel density of 460 ppi. The display supports HDR10 and Dolby Vision, which means it can deliver stunning colors and contrast for watching videos and playing games. The display also has a refresh rate of 120Hz, which makes everything look smoother and more responsive. The display uses ProMotion technology, which adapts the refresh rate to the content on the screen, saving battery life and improving performance. The display also has an Always-On feature, which shows your personalized lock screen with your favorite widgets without having to tap the screen.Camera: The camera system of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is another major selling point. It features a quad-camera setup on the rear, consisting of a 48MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide camera, a 12MP 2x telephoto camera, and a 12MP 3x telephoto camera. The main camera has a quad-pixel sensor that can capture more detail and light in every shot. It also has a second-generation sensor-shift optical image stabilization, which reduces blur and shake in low-light conditions. The ultra-wide camera has a 120-degree field of view, which lets you capture more scenery and perspective in your photos. The telephoto cameras have optical-quality zoom, which lets you get closer to your subject without losing quality. The camera system also supports Night mode, Portrait mode, Panorama mode, Macro mode, Photographic Styles, and Smart HDR 4, which enhance your photos with advanced algorithms and effects. The camera system also supports Cinematic mode, which lets you shoot professional-looking videos in 4K HDR at 24 fps with depth-of-field control. You can also edit your videos in ProRes or Dolby Vision HDR formats on your device or on your Mac.Performance: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is powered by the A16 Bionic chip, which is the most powerful processor that Apple has ever created. It has a 6-core CPU, a 5-core GPU, and a 16-core Neural Engine, which work together to deliver fast and smooth performance for any task. The A16 Bionic chip can handle demanding workloads such as gaming, video editing, augmented reality, machine learning, and more with ease. It also has a power-efficient design, which allows it to run at high speeds for longer without draining the battery.Battery: The battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is impressive as well. It has a large 4,400 mAh battery that can last up to 29 hours of video playback or up to 23 hours of video streaming on a single charge. It also supports fast charging with a USB-C to Lightning cable or a MagSafe charger, which can charge up to 50% in just 30 minutes. It also supports wireless charging with any Qi-compatible charger or accessory.Overall experience: The iPhone 14 Pro Max is an amazing device that offers everything you could ask for in a smartphone. It has a gorgeous design, a brilliant display, a fantastic camera system, and an incredible performance. It is easy to use and secure with iOS 16, which offers many new features and improvements such as Dynamic Island, Action mode, FaceTime SharePlay, Live Text, Focus, Safari redesign, and more. It also works seamlessly with other Apple devices and services such as AirPods, Apple Watch, iCloud, Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and more.The iPhone 14 Pro Max is not for everyone though. It is a very large and heavy device, which may not be comfortable for some people to hold or carry. It is also very expensive, starting at ₹1,29,900 for the 128GB model and going up to ₹1,69,900 for the 1TB model. It also does not have a headphone jack, a microSD card slot, or a fingerprint scanner, which may be deal-breakers for some users.However, if you are looking for the ultimate smartphone experience and you don't mind the size, the price, or the lack of some features, then the iPhone 14 Pro Max is the perfect choice for you. It is a device that will impress you with its design, display, camera, and performance. It is a device that will make you feel like a pro.",5139

Rohit D.,5.0 out of 5 stars,21-Sep-22,Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max,No Details,"Welcome to ""Dynamic Island""","The delivery was a bit delayed considering I pre-ordered the phone as soon as it launched.However the phone is an absolute beast. Took around 1.5 hours to move from Android to iOS (Move to iOS app) but the process was really smooth. Really digging the Purple colour. Installed Spigen EZFit screen protector right out of the box without any hasslesPros -Battery Backup - Should last for slightly more than a full day on heavy usage.Display - Gets extremely bright even in sunny outdoorsPerformance - A16 really shines even though it's not a big jump up from the A15Premium - Feels like you own an expensive phone. I've had a few Pixel, OnePlus and Samsung phones in the past, but nothing feels as premium as this.Move to iOS - For me, the Android to iOS movement was pretty smooth. Managed to transfer around 400 contacts, 3000 Messages, 15GB of whatsapp data (Your mileage may vary)Camera - No regrets here. Every shot that you take might be one of the best shots any phone camera can take.Cons -Expensive - Considering the price wasn't changed in U.S., it's still a very expensive phoneAvailability - A bit harder to get right now (My brother still struggling with his pre-order from Amazon)",1192
Harsh Singh,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Nov-22,Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max,No Details,Best iPhone yet.,"Upgraded from my galaxy S8+ so I could feel a significant difference. The phone is off the charts, it’s that damn good. And the colour gold looks extremely gorgeous in person than in the videos. I carry my phone without a case and there is no doubt it looks like a piece of jewellery, gotten immense compliments for it. Won’t bore you all with the geeky details which can be easily found on the web. All I can say the interface is way too smooth and the dynamic island is a funky lil feature that I love the most about this phone. The always on display is creatively done, stands out in the crowd, ppl instantly know which phone you’re carrying. Plus when the album art of Apple Music that stays in the AOD is a lovely lil touch. All in all if you can afford it, go for it. Believe me you’ll not regret it, it is miles better than iPhone 12 and 13. The Pro models of iPhone 14 are definitely worth it. I got my money’s worth with this phone, it is absolutely gorgeous and pleasing to look at it.",995

Milton,5.0 out of 5 stars,25-Jan-23,Apple iPhone 14 Pro Max,No Details,Great,"Apple hasn’t made any bones about the fact that there are certain products it has that aren’t meant for everyone. Some of these — like the Mac Studio or even the Mac mini — are way too niche and will be sought by those who really need them. And then there are those that bring the best of Apple at an expensive — very expensive — price point but are desired by many. The iPhone’s Pro models have always been in the category — the coveted one, the desirable one, the one that makes you want to junk that financial prudence that has been drilled in you. The iPhone 14 Pro Max is very much that phone — the best of Apple and by now you know that it is an expensive phone. Rs 1,39,900 is the starting price and there’s little point in debating on why it’s so expensive and whether it’s value for money or not. It’s an Apple product, it is an iPhone, and it is the Pro Max variant — of course it will be expensive. Apple wants your money and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that dangling proposition that may just want you to break the bank and get one.DESIGN AND DISPLAYSeen one? Seen all. If you have seen the iPhone 12 Pro Max or the iPhone 13 Pro Max then the iPhone 14 Pro Max has very little different to offer in terms of design. It’s a popular design with a stainless frame that looks elegant and the frosted glass back is still gorgeous to look at. Apple knows that this design is a hit and there’s no point in expecting it to change anytime soon. Generally, an Apple design lasts for years before a new one comes. Don’t believe us? Look at the MacBook Air, which followed a similar design philosophy for years till the M2 model arrived this year. So don’t expect Apple to make wholesale changes to the design every year, you will only get disappointed.The one remarkable thing about the design of the iPhone 14 Pro Max is that yes, you have seen it before and yes, it hasn’t changed but it still looks great. But do keep in mind that this is a really big phone. If you aren’t used to a big phone then perhaps think twice before getting this or look at the iPhone 14 Pro instead. I wouldn’t call it unwieldy but yes, it is certainly not a one-handed phone. The Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra felt really big but this one feels rather bigger in the hand. And yes, it is heavy as well at 240 grams.The big size is preferred by many as it brings in a big display and it’s a compromise many would settle for on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. The 6.7-inch OLED display offers a resolution of 2796 x 1290 pixel and 460ppi pixel density. What’s that in common parlance? An excellent display that is great to look at, colour reproduction is accurate and the brightness levels are optimum. Apple claims that the iPhone 14 Pro Max offers the maximum brightness in a smartphone — 2000 nits of brightness in direct sunlight. We had zero problems reading on the iPhone 14 Pro Max even when it was really sunny outside.The 120Hz ProMotion refresh rate works as smoothly as it did on the iPhone 13 Pro Max — no complaints or no changes here to see. The display is extremely snappy and a lot of it is down to iOS 16 as well as Apple does handle animations much better than most of its competition does.If the refresh rate and other specs remain the same, then there’s something new in the form of the Always-on display. Better late than never, some may say. Apple is fashionably late but has arrived in some style. Now I am sure you must have read that some Android phone brought Always-on display first. Heck, even Google couldn’t resist the temptation to take a dig at Apple during its biggest hardware event of 2022. But Apple has created a perception that it isn’t in the rat race and that some features might not come first but they do come with a difference. Like the Always-on display.Apple’s implementation of Always-on display is unlike any other smartphone. What happens on the iPhone 14 Pro Max when Always-on display is turned on is that the lock screen is dimmed. “Display, display on the phone, who’s the prettiest of ‘em all?” It’s the iPhone 14 Pro Max with the Always-on display. You can see notifications, lock screen widgets and everything else but it is subtly dimmed. If you have an iPhone and you use it for the first time, you might feel that was there a need for this? Not really but once you’ve used it, I bet you will not be able to use the iPhone 14 Pro Max without toggling on the Always-on display.DYNAMIC ISLANDNow generally we tend to keep all display features in one sub-head but we are making an exception for the Dynamic Island. After all it is the belle of the ball, the headline act of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. Or at least it’s the most-talked about feature on this year’s iPhones. And it does deserve a separate section as it is delightfully done. The notch was Apple’s gift to the smartphone industry. The first year after the launch of iPhone X — the first one with the notch — Android brands made a beeline to adopt the notch as if Santa Claus handed it out on Christmas. But then Android phone makers came up with their really good iterations of it and Apple stuck with the notch until the Dynamic Island arrived with the iPhone 14 Pro models. And man, it is so well done that you just keep fiddling with it only for the first few days — at least that’s what I found myself doing. The Dynamic Island is a different take on the notch and makes the use of that space which no one else ever thought of doing it before Apple. Not a fan of the name but this is a really cool feature to use and is not gimmicky at all.For someone who uses Apple Music a lot more than one should, the Dynamic Island is a treat. It will show the album artwork along the playback controls, and the waveform, AirPlay — all in that tiny little space. If you are using any app and get an incoming call, then the Dynamic Island will show the alert and all the call controls. AirPods Pro’s battery life also appears in the Dynamic Island. Apple Maps directions also come on the Dynamic Island and so much so that at times I did ditch Google Maps for it because it looks really good.Apple has always had a way of showing all these notifications but never had a ‘home’ — which is now the Dynamic Island. In a few months, here’s hoping that other developers take advantage of the Dynamic Island as it is a really fun and useful feature. Apple is expected to launch Live Activities API soon and that’s when we will really see the Dynamic Island thrive and it is something that should get a lot of people excited. Is the feature good enough to pay the difference between the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Pro price? It certainly is if you want the complete iPhone experience.CAMERAIt has been well established that the iPhone cameras are one of the most consistent and versatile ones around. Apple seemed mightily reluctant to get in the megapixel race and remained steady with 12MP cameras. A case of better late than never yet again and once more Apple has done it differently. The primary camera now has a 48MP sensor, which produces some excellent images. All the images clicked from the 48MP camera have rich colours and look exceptionally vibrant and true to life. There are a lot of details captured especially in the images which were clicked using ProRAW. Like every other 48MP camera, Apple too uses pixel binning to give you 12MP images only but the ProRAW mode actually gives you 48MP images. And the difference is quite stark as more details are captured. But the trade-off is that images clicked with the 48MP camera consume a lot of space, like a lot. The photos we clicked ranged anywhere between 12MB to 42MB — so use it rather judiciously. Of course, ProRAW is meant not just for utilising the 48MP camera.What works in the favour of the primary 48MP camera — with and without pixel binning — is the consistency it offers. You can be clicking in good lighting condition or not-so-good conditions, the iPhone 14 Pro Max delivers images that make you sit up and take note. Apple has certainly improved low-light photography as the iPhone 14 Pro Max does a wonderful job when the lights are dimmed. What the 48MP primary camera also gives is the option of 2x optical zoom lens — a nice addition to the iPhone 14 Pro Max’s camera’s arsenal.The other 12MP cameras — telephoto and ultra-wide — also do a fine job of clicking images. Portraits clicked on the iPhone 14 Pro Max look great and bokeh effect is spot on. Apple’s computational photography has been a step ahead of others and on the iPhone 14 Pro Max you get the Photonic Engine. As per Apple, this is meant to improve colour reproduction and click better images in less light.The lack of zoom on the telephoto camera now does rankle a bit. The iPhone 14 Pro Max offers 3x zoom at a time when the likes of Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra can go up to 100x. I do wish Apple brings more zoom capabilities on the next iPhone as it is perhaps the only feature that is missing on these cameras.The Macro mode — enabled automatically — is a true delight on the iPhone 14 Pro Max. No one has done a better job with the macro mode than Apple as the results are truly excellent. Try capturing fabrics with the iPhone 14 Pro Max and the level of details is fascinating to see. You will find macro modes in so many smartphones’ cameras but the iPhone 14 Pro Max is a cut above the rest.For the selfie/usfie/groupfie/whateverfie brigade, Apple has added a brand new camera. The 12MP camera now gets autofocus and it is really impressive. And it really shows in FaceTime calls or other video calls as well. There’s more clarity than there ever was on any iPhone. The front camera is a significant improvement on the iPhone 14 Pro Max.Where the iPhone 14 Pro Max’s camera really shines is videos. Apple brought Cinematic Mode last year with the iPhone 13 Pros and with the iPhone 14 Pros, you get the all-new Action Mode. No, it’s not a gimbal or anything like that. What it does is it really it offers really good stabilisation and that’s because Apple has improved EIS (electronic image stabilisation). You don’t get 4K recording with this mode as maximum resolution offered is 2.8K but it is still very good. The footage almost always remained really stable. The Cinematic Mode still remains great fun to use.Is this the best camera setup in any smartphone? Not exactly but it is certainly most versatile and consistent cameras in any smartphone. Almost every image is pleasing to look at and more than anything, the iPhone 14 Pro Max makes you want to click more images — something that I can’t say about any other smartphone, except the Pixel phones.PERFORMANCE, BATTERY LIFEThis will be rather short and concise: the A-series Bionic processors on the iPhones have always been blazing fast and the iPhone 14 Pro Max with A16 is no different. The phone is a total powerhouse in every sense and handles all sorts of tasks comically well. You really can’t find any fault in the performance of the iPhone 14 Pro Max as it really is flawless. The iOS 16 experience is still getting refined so you might see a bug here and there but I expect Apple to sort that out soon.The iPhone 13 Pro Max by far had the best battery performance I have seen in all the phones reviewed in the last 12 months. Expectations were lofty from the iPhone 14 Pro Max and it was a rather bumpy start. In the first few days, with just under 5 hours of screen time, the phone had consumed close to 84% battery — alarm bells did ring as Apple did tout the battery life of the iPhone 14 Pro Max. However after a few days normalcy was resumed as with six hours of screen time — with Always-on enabled — the iPhone 14 Pro Max still had 40% battery left. Does the Always-on display consume a lot of battery?Slightly but it’s not a battery guzzling feature. Overall, with a lot of streaming on Apple Music, Safari, WhatsApp, social media activities on a daily basis, the iPhone 14 Pro Max can really go on for a day — and then some — on a single charge.VERDICTApple has made a habit of making excellent smartphones and the iPhone 14 Pro Max is no different. There’s no escaping the fact that the iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the most expensive smartphones you can buy — starting at Rs 1,39,900 and goes up to Rs 1,89,900 (1TB storage variant). You might think that it will be a hard sell especially in a country like India. India still remains a vanilla iPhone island but the aspiration to go Pro is strong as ever.This year Apple has really separated the Pro models from the vanilla ones with the iPhone 14 series. And there is still an audience that salivates at the thought of getting an iPhone Pro — perhaps they have used the vanilla and want an upgrade or they are the ones that just want the best of Apple. The iPhone 14 Pro Max gets the best of Apple in every sense. The display is a delight — Dynamic Island is great fun — and the cameras have been upgraded as well. Should you go for it? Without battling an eyelid as long as you can splash the cash The iPhone 14 Pro Max is one of the best smartphones money can buy.",13009

I was already using iPhone 13 Pro Max from past 11 months and had say it is still the best value for money iPhone you can buy this time, at least in India considering huge price jump from previous models. I only purchased iPhone 14 Pro Max just because of “Dynamic Island” and tbh i literally got bored after few minutes of using and experimenting with it. Well definitely it’s a fresh design but is it really worth paying almost 40K extra for that new notch? I would say go with 13 pro/max and save your money. Also I am surprised that this iphone is so demanding this year, if you have already planned to buy 14 pro/max then you have to wait for a month or so…it is literally out of stock from everywhere.

Sandy Cariappa,5.0 out of 5 stars,07-Oct-23,Apple iPhone 15,Colour: BlueSize: 128 GB,iPhone XR to iPhone 15,"Just made the transition and here’s my POV on the first ~2 month of usePros- Battery Life is awesome, easily get about a day plus on this, so no Compliants- Screen fluidity is smooooooth! Understandable as I’m transitioning into an OLED from LCD in XR. The panel gets a solid peak brightness quotient so happy here- Screen brightness is good as compared to XR, 2200 nits, but I hardly go beyond 30% brightness to save some juice. Whilst outside I did crank it up and it’s spotless- Dynamic Island is fun, yet to use it to the fullest. Like the way it shows the ETA on delivery and Uber. Simple solution instead of you having to get into the app to check on the ETA- Weight, this phone is soo bloody light!! Understandable as XR was a brick, this is soo welcome- Camera is awesome, love the 48MP intervention, the portrait mode and cinematic mode does the job for me.- The Apple eco system, I enjoy seamless integration of my Watch, Mac, IPad Air and IPhone- Apples approach on Security!- Transferring data from my XR to 15 using the built in app is flawlessCons- The phone was over heating , there is a solution to this from Apple = back up the phone and then erase and reset the phone… including your eSIM settings.. once done set up the phone with the back up….. works like a charm- I still believe Apple should have thrown in a charging brick with such purchasesIndustry memes- USB C : honestly don’t give a jack for the reviews out there on this. It’s just a mode of charging for me and that’s it. I’m not going to be transferring any data so yea, 2.0 speed yadadada - thank you so much- Blue is not blue but white! Think people whining about this should go back to 13/14 or those ludicrous blues in Androids!! These are pestle shades people!!- Buying an Apple product to show off!! I mean, you even serious? You buy a product and then comment on why you should not buy one?- 60hz refresh rate for a 80k phone : save your jokes people, there are many of us who appreciate quality and security than how the screen refreshes. For non gamers like me, panel that is here is apt. I’ve seen a ton of folks buying 120hz phones and using it only to make calls, watch some videos and for textingTips of managing battery health- Switch off background app refresh for apps you don’t need back ground refresh- Avoid wireless charging as this heats your devise up- I charge my phone only using a power bank  not direct wired or wireless charging- Don’t let the battery go below 20%, keep it always between 95% and 20%- Switch off location services and allow only certain app that needs your location service- Switch on Charging Optimisation under the battery section- I don’t use vibrate mode for rings/incoming calls etc- My XR after 5 years of use has 86% battery health so I guess I know what I’m recommending aboveVendor Experience : Appario Retail Private Limited. 5/5, been a regular customer and they have never disappointed me even once. The purchase experience is breezy and quick, thanks team for the support and look forward to the collaboration in the future.….. watch out for this space. Will keep updating in case of significant change in experience",3154
Rohan narvekar,5.0 out of 5 stars,24-Jul-24,Apple iPhone 15,Colour: BlueSize: 128 GB,Iphone from Apple as usual top in quality and experiance.,"First of it looks very very prime quality and nicely fit in your hands. I am an android user still I don't face issue at the time of operating. In India you have to download required apps from app store free of cost. Apple store not available in India. You can use two sim , one physical micro sim and other esim. Conversion of physical micro sim to esim is very easy and happen in just two hours from your home. But after conversion sms service restricted for 24 hours as per guidelines if TRAI. No issue of connectivity if you have good network strength of your desired operator. Very crispy screen gives no strain on your eyes. Battery life is awesome , 1 one day for heavy user and 2 days for light user. Smooth performance of IOS system, no lags ,no glitches , not a single problem when you get to use. Sound is also very big but very crystal clear. Value is on high side,  so though it is very good in all aspects,  many people may find it very difficult to purchase .",974

Surprisingly, it feels the same. The battery life is solid, providing around 1.5 days for mild phone users. As a developer, with light usage for content consumption and social media, I get around 8 hours of screen on time with 25-30% battery left. It charges quickly to 50% and then trickle charges to 100%, adapting to usage patterns for faster charging. Initially, there were some battery drain and heating issues, but they resolved as the phone learned my usage patterns.Now, the camera is impressive, especially in low light conditions. Despite lacking a dedicated long exposure mode, the default night option, averaging around 3 seconds, captures details even in the dark. Compared to the iPhone 14 and S21FE, the camera quality is top-notch. The auto portrait detection is a standout feature. Believe me no one explain the real use of that auto portrait theoretically until you try it.In terms of network, the dual 5G standby supports Vi and JIO 5G (eSim). Inside my house, I get around 500 Mbps, and outside easily surpass 1 Gbps. Call quality is excellent, with two introduced modes in the mic option available in the control center.This is my personal opinion; I'll update if I find anything noteworthy.",1340

Mohammed Ajaas,4.0 out of 5 stars,12-Jul-24,Apple iPhone 15,Colour: BlackSize: 128 GB,No big changes. Disappointed,Not that good. Phone is handy and for me I doesn’t make sense as iPhone X and 15 looks similar and refresh rate too poor. They charged more but big theifs even their competitors are eager to fetch money from customers but not ready to give worth the money. Customers need to slowly have to reject these brands and btw last 14 years using Apple products but it is worst in the sense not much up gradation. iPhone 15 pro max even pathetic,436

The corners are noticeably curvier compared to the previous version, making the device sleeker. Unfortunately, the phone slipped out of my pant pocket while I was in an auto, and I only noticed after returning home. I quickly grabbed my iPad, locked my device, and used the ‘Find My’ app to track down my phone. Thankfully, it ended up in the hands of someone who wasn’t very tech-savvy and couldn’t figure out how to turn it off using the key combination. This allowed me to successfully locate and retrieve my device. Overall, it was quite an adventure. Now I slapped a rubber case on it and it’s not going anywhere.",670

Camera is good. Video is excellent, call reception is excellent, screen is really smooth ( if u have never used 120hz). Gaming is smooth although I won’t recommend for long and heavy gaming as it would drain the battery. Charging is quick. If you use 20WT APPLE power adapter then you would notice heat while charging. Then goes back normal after getting charged above 70%. In hand feel of the phone is really good. Base model itself feels more premium like pro models. Type c is really a good addition as it creates more functionality. Screen is really bright and visible even under direct sunlight. This is by far the best upgrade of base model iPhone in years.

Even with iOS 17.1.1 the phone heats up while using (surprisingly not much while charging through MagSafe Charger).Fantastic camera setup, though a 5X zoom is missed. Speakers are loud and clear.Battery life is good, charges fast on Apple 20W charger and the supplied braided TypeC to TypeC cable.",333

Sahil Qureshi,4.0 out of 5 stars,12-Nov-23,Apple iPhone 15 Pro,Colour: Natural TitaniumSize: 256 GB,Best Phone at this price range (Pun intended),"I recently got into Apple system with a purchase of iPad Air 5. Looking at the my usage, iPad fit well with my overall system so I decided to switch to iPhone from OnePlus 7 after 4 years of usage.I have to say that iPhone does have a premium feel to it, not only in appearance but in performance and UI too. Switching and transferring data and WhatsApp are fairly simple now with Move to IOS app. After setting up my phone in a day, it was ready for daily use without keeping my Android along as a secondary device.Big worry before buying 15 pro was reported overheating issues but Apple has fixed that problem with iOS 17.0.3 and I haven’t encountered heating issues after initial setup process.I will get straight to pros and cons below:Pros:1. ProMotion: You can feel 120hz vs 60hz right away.2. Camera: Point and shoot without hassle. But one needs to check out few YouTube tutorials to understand Camera app settings thoroughly.3. Customisation: Yes this sounds strange but Shortcuts app on iOS is so powerful. You can do many system level customisation with shortcuts and automation.4. Battery life: With medium usage, I get through whole day. Stats for nerds: it averages above 4.2 min per 1% discharge and gives me 7+ hrs of estimated SOT. Estimated here because I don’t use full 0-100% charge and discharge cycles.5. Performance and Security: No further description should be required.6. 80% Charge limit: This setting helps when I keep my phone plugged in to car for CarPlay because it stops overcharging to 100%.7. Weight: I haven’t myself experienced difference in in-hand feel of 15 Pro vs previous generation Pro models but my colleagues and friends who own Pro model of previous generations notice the difference in weight first hand.Cons:1. Apple keyboard takes some typing to get used to.2. Notifications could be a mess if you like having notification from all apps enabled. I keep most of mine turned off so no biggie for me.3. Simple tasks as custom ringtone, streaming music to car through Bluetooth needs work around or hacks you find on YouTube.",2069

Many changes and seamless experience but the only issue that exists is the heating issue . The phone heats up while charging , maybe its because of the fast charging but apart from that just browsing Instagram for a certain period heats up the phone. The phone is on the latest update but the issue for heating is yet to be resolved completely. Apart from that everything is flawless especially the camera. Its better if you upgrade from an old Iphone as the experience is flawless.",526

If you're already using the 13 pro or 14 Pro, there seems to be little incentive to make the leap.The camera improvements are noteworthy, capturing detail and clarity like never before. However, beyond this feature, the 15 Pro Max doesn't offer a significant leap in terms of innovation. Personally, I find the Pro versions more manageable in hand, and the Max variant, although boasting a larger screen, can be a bit unwieldy.In essence, the 15 Pro Max is a solid device with a stellar camera, but for those already enjoying the perks of the previous Pro models, the upgrade might not feel as compelling.",787

I've encountered software issues, with many apps and games not performing well. There are problems with phone calls—calls drop frequently, requiring me to restart the phone each time. Initially, I thought it might be due to other apps or network providers, but I used to use an Android phone with the same network and common apps, and they performed much better.

Carelien,1.0 out of 5 stars,07-Aug-24,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,Colour: White TitaniumSize: 256 GB,SCAM!!!,"We got scammed!! This is not an iPhone. Me and my husband are long time iPhone users and this is some cheap Android interface inside an iPhone casing. This seller doesn’t want to return our product or refund as “it is out of stock”. I am very very upset as this is a high value item that is completely useless. Slow, pixelated, not even iPhone interface. Beware!!",363
Rahul S,5.0 out of 5 stars,04-Dec-23,Apple iPhone 15 Pro Max,Colour: Natural TitaniumSize: 256 GB,"Worth every penny, awesome battery life","If you already have 14 Pro or Pro Max then don't upgrade, but if you've any other Pro or non Pro models go for it. If you need an iPhone with 24-26hr battery life on a single charge then go for Pro Max models. No doubt Apple's 4K 60fps ProRes is really awesome, and the all new type-c port is the best thing Apple has done in years. Also all the type-c cables included in the box are woven design, now expecting this will not turn grey after few months of use.",460
